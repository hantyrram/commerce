The $id is just a string identifier, it will not  be used to download the schema,

The $id will be the base URI when referencing it. 
   e.g. if external.json's $id = "external", and it contains a definition
      definition: {
         type: object
         something: {
            type: string
         }
      }
you may reference "something" on other json as $ref: "external#/definition/something"

you must add definition ajv.addSchema(definition) first before creating a validator using ajv.compile(<the subject>)

validator = ajv.addSchema(definition).compile(subject); where subject is the object to be validated
